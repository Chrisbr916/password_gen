# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

In this project we were asked to create a password generTOR.  all the code that i changed had to do with javascript. I had to create some functions that would cycle through the length of the password and fill it with numbers letters and symbols depending on what the user has choosen. I had to fill each variable with some things. Then wrote a function that would choose a random number or letter to fill with the spot until the length that the user choose. this would all happen when the user inciates the process with a click.
